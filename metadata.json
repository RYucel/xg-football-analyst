  "prompt": "Generate a web application that serves as an advanced tool for football betting analysis. The core of the application should be an Expected Goals (xG) calculator that uses the Poisson distribution to determine various match probabilities, such as match winner, correct score, and over/under goals. The app should allow users to either input xG values manually or select teams from major European leagues (like the Premier League, La Liga, and SÃ¼per Lig) to automatically populate team-specific xG data. It should also feature a 'Value Bet' analysis tool where users can input bookmaker odds to compare them against the app's calculated probabilities. This tool should include a Kelly Criterion calculator to suggest optimal stake sizes based on the user's bankroll. To provide qualitative insights, integrate Google's Gemini API to generate an AI-powered pre-match analysis, covering aspects like team form, key players, and tactical predictions. The user interface should be modern, intuitive, and responsive, with a dark theme and clear data visualization."
