# Football Betting Analysis Application

## Overview
This is a comprehensive football betting analysis tool built with React and TypeScript that provides advanced statistical modeling and AI-powered insights for football match predictions. The application combines multiple analytical approaches including Poisson distribution modeling, Elo rating systems, contrarian analysis, and AI-generated match insights.

## Core Features

### 1. Statistical Analysis Models

#### Poisson Distribution (xG) Calculator
- **Primary Function**: Calculates match outcome probabilities using expected goals (xG) data
- **Implementation**: Uses Poisson distribution with memoized factorial calculations for performance
- **Outputs**:
  - Full-time result probabilities (Win/Draw/Loss)
  - Over/Under goal probabilities
  - Both Teams to Score (BTTS) probabilities
  - Clean sheet probabilities
  - Correct score matrix (0-4 goals)
- **Data Source**: Team xG and xGA statistics from league databases

#### Elo Rating System
- **Function**: Alternative probability calculation based on team strength ratings
- **Implementation**: Standard Elo formula with home field advantage (65 points)
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic draw probability calculation based on rating difference
  - Two-way probability distribution for win/loss scenarios
  - Empirically derived constants for realistic draw probabilities

#### Contrarian Analysis
- **Purpose**: Identifies value betting opportunities by analyzing historical performance vs market expectations
- **Methodology**: Implements "The Contrarian Betting System" scoring logic
- **Calculation**: 
  - Win: (1 - 1/odds) points
  - Loss/Draw: (-1/odds) points
- **Signal Strength**: Categorizes opportunities as strong, weak, or none

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

#### Gemini AI Integration
- **Service**: Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- **Function**: Generates comprehensive pre-match analysis
- **Analysis Includes**:
  - Match overview and context
  - Recent form analysis (last 5 games)
  - Key players to watch
  - Tactical considerations
  - Match outcome predictions
- **Output**: Formatted markdown analysis

### 3. Value Betting Tools

#### Margin Calculator
- **Purpose**: Removes bookmaker margins to find true odds
- **Methods Implemented**:
  - Equal Margin Model
  - Proportional (Additive) Margin Model
  - Odds Ratio Model
  - Logarithmic Model
- **Features**: Calculates overround and provides fair value odds

#### Arbitrage Calculator
- **Function**: Identifies risk-free betting opportunities across multiple bookmakers
- **Features**:
  - Multi-bookmaker odds comparison
  - Automatic stake calculation for guaranteed profit
  - Profit percentage calculation
  - Best odds identification per outcome

#### Kelly Criterion Implementation
- **Purpose**: Optimal bet sizing based on edge and odds
- **Integration**: Built into bet tracking and value assessment
- **Risk Management**: Helps determine appropriate stake sizes

### 4. Data Management

#### League Support
- **Turkish SÃ¼per Lig**: Complete team statistics with xG data
- **Premier League**: Team data and Elo ratings
- **La Liga**: Statistical data for Spanish teams
- **Data Structure**: Rank, matches played, xG, xGA, xGD, Elo ratings, match history

#### Team Statistics
- **Core Metrics**:
  - Expected Goals (xG) - offensive capability
  - Expected Goals Against (xGA) - defensive strength
  - Expected Goal Difference (xGD) - overall team quality
  - Elo Rating - dynamic strength rating
  - Match History - last 5 games with results and fair odds

### 5. User Interface Features

#### Modern Design
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme
- **Layout**: Responsive design with mobile optimization
- **Color Scheme**: Purple/gray theme with gradient backgrounds

#### Navigation Structure

- **Analysis Sub-tabs**: Poisson, Elo, Gemini AI, Contrarian
- **Interactive Components**: Team selectors, input forms, results displays

#### Bet Tracking System
- **Features**:
  - Log bets with opening odds
  - Track closing line value (CLV)
  - Performance analytics
  - Bet history management
- **Data Tracked**: Date, teams, bet type, stake, odds, CLV, profit/loss
